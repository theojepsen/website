<p>My main disciplinary affiliation is European modern environmental history, but I could also be termed a social historian, a historical geographer, or a digital humanist.</p>
<p>I was a postgraduate fellow at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, held a postdoctoral position, funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento, at the Universit&agrave; di Trento, Italy, and was a Carson Fellow at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich. I was also an associated researcher at the <em>Laboratorio di Storia delle Alpi <&#47;em>of the Universit&agrave; della Svizzera Italiana.</p>
<p>Until recently I was employed at the Rachel Carson Center as Digital Humanities Research Specialist, while holding as well a position as Scholar-in-Residence at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Currently I am DAAD Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>My most recent research activities focus on the social history of the environment and on the history of science. In particular, I have analysed conflicts about rights to access resources, the history of nature conservation, and the development of the concept of mean sea level. </p>
<p>On this site you may find my vita, a list of publications and talks, my teaching and a link to my not so frequently updated blog. You can also download a pdf of my CV <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.dropbox.com&#47;s&#47;cfhuyqs6bx1uzpl&#47;Hardenberg_CV_20141030.pdf?dl=0">here<&#47;a>.</p>
