My main disciplinary affiliation is European modern environmental history, but I could also be termed a social historian, a historical geographer, or a digital humanist.

I was a postgraduate fellow at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, held a postdoctoral position, funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento, at the Università di Trento, Italy, and was a Carson Fellow at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society in Munich. I was also an associated researcher at the Laboratorio di Storia delle Alpi of the Università della Svizzera Italiana.

Until recently I was employed at the Rachel Carson Center as Digital Humanities Research Specialist, while holding as well a position as Scholar-in-Residence at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Currently I am DAAD Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My most recent research activities focus on the social history of the environment and on the history of science. In particular, I have analysed conflicts about rights to access resources, the history of nature conservation, and the development of the concept of mean sea level.
