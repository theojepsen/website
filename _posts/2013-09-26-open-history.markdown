<p>I am seriously considering the possibility to follow W. Caleb McDaniel's (<a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;wcaleb" target="_blank">@wcaleb<&#47;a>) <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu&#47;" target="_blank">steps<&#47;a> and set up a wiki or some other system (Github, maybe?) where to make my research process and notes open source (in part they are already, if you look at my <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.zotero.org&#47;wilko.hardenberg&#47;items" target="_blank">Zotero library<&#47;a>). Caleb has some very convincing motives to do this, and his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wcm1.web.rice.edu&#47;open-notebook-history.html" target="_blank">blog post<&#47;a> on this is definitely the place to look at if you need to be convinced.</p>
<p>This will be part of a general overhaul of the whole site, which I hope to be able to undertake some time before the beginning of next semester. I'll try to keep you posted.</p>
